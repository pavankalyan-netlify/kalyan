      <p>Eleven years ago, I discovered blogging. Inspired by my clients’ stories and their questions, I began posting weekly, then daily for a while. I hadn’t written for an audience since I left school more than thirty years before. Nobody was more surprised than I was to discover that people wanted to read what I wrote here and in the books that followed.</p>

      <p>Fast forward to 2019, when I decided it was finally time to follow my heart and begin writing my debut novel set in Dublin. And today, I’m thrilled to share it with you. <em>The Making of Her</em> publishes in the U.S. today and is available through all great bookstores. The Australian edition was published in May with an equally gorgeous cover.</p>

      <p>You can hear a sample of Aoife McMahon’s brilliant audiobook performance <a href="link-to-sample">here</a>.</p>

      <p>If I hadn’t spent a decade blogging, I wouldn’t have had the courage to begin writing a novel. I have every reader who subscribed to, read and shared my blog to thank for showing me that creativity is a journey, not a destination.</p>
